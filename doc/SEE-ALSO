    $ git clone https://github.com/wa1tnr/ainsuForth-gen-exp-crkt.git

    This is a slight variant of ainsuForth biased towards
    use with Crickit (CPX variant; the first Crickit board
    from Adafruit)

    D37 is the internal LED, when compiled against ItsyBitsyM0 in Arduino IDE.

    See that repository for the rest of the pinouts in this configuration.

Quick test (load the other repository; then compile against ItsyBitsyM0) and type:

: crkLED 37 ;
: OUTPUT 1 ;
: HIGH 1 ;
: LOW 0 ;
: blink OUTPUT crkLED pinMode HIGH crkLED pinWrite 500 delay LOW crkLED pinWrite 500 delay ;
blink blink blink


END.
